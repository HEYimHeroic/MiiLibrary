**Game name/platform**
Use the format "[Game Name], for [Device]". If the Mii(s) you're requesting do not come from a game, simply explain where they do come from. Make sure you also replace "GAME_NAME" in this issue title with the name of the game/location the Miis come from.

**How many Miis are in this game?**
Are you aware of how many Miis are in this game? A good, accurate number can help me decide my priorities. If you do not know, simply say so.
